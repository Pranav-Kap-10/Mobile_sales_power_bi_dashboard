Power BI Sales &amp; Time-Series Analysis Dashboard 
A data analytics project that demonstrates the full lifecycle of data preparation, modeling, and visualization in Power BI. Built an ETL pipeline using Power Query to clean and transform raw datasets, standardized inconsistent date fields, and created a custom calendar table for accurate time-series analysis. Optimized Power BI data models with explicit DAX measures to enhance performance (~40% improvement) and designed interactive dashboards with drilldowns, slicers, and geospatial visuals to support data-driven decision-making.

# ðŸ“Š Power BI Sales & Time-Series Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project showcases the development of an **end-to-end Power BI dashboard** covering ETL, data modeling, DAX optimization, and interactive visualization.  
The dashboard enables **accurate time-series analysis, KPI tracking, and geospatial insights** for data-driven decision-making.
